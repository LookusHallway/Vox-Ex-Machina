## Vox Ex Machina | Opera Philadelphia 50th Anniversary Gala
"Celebrate 50 years of Opera Philadelphia in a singular event that harnesses bold new technology to marry music and visual art. Vox Ex Machina, our golden anniversary gala, will bring together opera stars and emerging artists performing favorites from the operatic canon alongside new music, all while their voices are translated into visual works of art live onstage at the Academy of Music." - [Opera Philadelphia](https://www.operaphila.org/whats-on/2526-season/vox-ex-machina/)

# Max MSP and Arduino
- This GitHub repo contains the Max MSP patch and Arduino Code for the system.
- Vox Ex Machina takes operating singing as an input and maps it to a 2D coordinate plane, which is painted using 3 stepper motors.
